The sudden uptick & interest in "devops" over the past few years is driven by
Cloud. With a capital C. Historically, operations built out the infrastructure
and then slapped the application on top of it that the developers had
produced. As your application gets bigger and so does your infrastructure,
things get harder. Welcome to the Cloud Forcing Function.

In a world where people talk about Infrastructure-as-a-Service, the real key
to growing at _scale_ is _Productizing your Infrastructure_. 

## What do we mean by Productizing?

Let's start with the definition of a product. Put simply, a product is
something that is manufactured for sale or distribution. However, when we talk
about building software, there are a lot more implications.

* It's designed
* It can be repeatably built and delivered
* It has tangible features
* Each component is tested and has some level of quality

Put another way, the way we build software systems should also be the way we
build the Infrastructure. Think 
[Systems Development Life Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle)
 
Building your infrastructure should be approached no differently to the way we build
software. 

Quite simply, get out of the business of _doing stuff_ and into the business
of _building stuff_. 

## Symptoms of not having products

* Repeated requests for the same item over and over 
* Making direct changes to live running servers & network devices 
* Frequently having to revisit issues that you thought you had resolved

Paul Graham, an extremely prominent writer & startup accelerator founder,
talks specifically [about the idea of startups being high growth focussed on
scale and says...](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html)

## Productize your consulting work

Simply building automation around common tasks is not the same as building a
product. Automation is internal to you. You need to have something that you
hand to your customers and step back from.

* Start managing your [Work in Progress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process)
* Start identifying work that is frequent and repititve 
* Distill one piece of work down to the [smallest possible piece that can deliver
value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)
* Build software to deliver that value to a customer
* Wash, Rinse, Repeat...
