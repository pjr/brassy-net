First of all, [watch this talk from Theo Schlossnagle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAP1zaXUvAE). 
I did a generic "career talk" for [CareerZoo](http://www.careerzoo.ie/)
previously which talks about [this idea of passion for your 
career](http://www.slideshare.net/PhilipReynolds4/your-career-a-hiring-managers-perspective).
I saw Theo's talk afterwards, which highlights so many of the same things. All
of my experience is very focussed around Linux and open source tools. 

## Beginner
* [Learn python](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)
    * You need to be a polyglot & know multiple languages. Start with python.
* Start learning bash 
* Understand how to install Linux and your distribution of choice
* Understand how to install packaging systems 
* 

## Intermediate

* Learn C
    * You don't necessarily need to build systems, but your ability to
    understand system calls

## Advanced

Practical things you can do...
- Get involved with your distribution of choice's packaging requirements
