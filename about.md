![Speaking at CareerZoo]({{ site.url }}/images/speaking-at-careerzoo.jpg){: .pull-right }

I am a 30 something manager working for [Workday](http://www.workday.com) with
a background in web hosting, cloud engineering and application development.
I've been working in management since 2011 but keep a keen interest and
passion for technology.

I was, what's fondly known as, a generalist. I've worked on everything from
data centre layouts, rack & cabling layouts, BGP configuration, FreeBSD kernel
development, pension management software, build systems, javascript, HTML and
a whole lot more in-between. My background is primarily with open source
software on BSD and more recently Linux systems. Nowadays, I play in my spare
time.

I work in the Platform Engineering area of Workday helping to construct and
improve our build pipelines, deployment tooling, monitoring systems &
virtualization platform.
