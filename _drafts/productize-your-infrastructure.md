## Intro

The sudden uptick & interest in "devops" over the past few years is driven by
Cloud. With a capital C. Historically, operations built out the infrastructure
and the developers slapped the application on top of it. As your application
gets bigger and so does your infrastructure, things get harder. Welcome to the
Cloud Forcing Function.

In a world where people talk about Infrastructure-as-a-Service, the real key
is actually what I'd call Productizing your Infrastructure. 

## What is a Product?

Put simply, a product is something that is manufactured. However, when we talk
about building software, there are a lot more implications than this, so I'll talk
about those..

* It's designed
* It can be repeatably built and delivered
* It has tangible features
* Each component is tested and has some level of quality

Put another way, the way we build software systems should also be the way we
build Infrastructure. Think
